        <p class="text">At Toppr, students are at the centre of our universe. We believe that every student is different
            and has
            different learning needs. We work relentlessly to solve student problems using advanced technology and help
            them learn better. We have thoughtfully designed Toppr to ensure that it is a one-stop after-school learning
            platform. It has more than 1.5 million learning pieces, including adaptive practice questions, solutions,
            concepts, and videos that come together seamlessly to give 360° learning. We use artificial intelligence
            based machine learning algorithms on top of this strong infrastructure, to create personalised learning
            paths for millions of students.
